Tanner Braun & Zhengyu Zhang

Reasons we choose Tanner's design: Better IO design, decoupled logic and IO, easy to extend Legend of Valor and change less codes to apply new game rules.

Tanner's design has a better IO interface. The ternimal instructions of the design are clear to read. And the design avoids overwhelming information outputs between two user commands. All classes extend IO class control the input/output information and decide which logical function should be invoked from the inputs. The IO classes were decoupled from the actual game logic which made it very easy to transfer over similary functionality from Legends: Monsters & Heroes. This meant that even though the structure of a battle changed from its own screen to being real-time on the world map, we were able to remove the BattleIO class, but keep the Battle class mostly the same. Having this decoupled logic allowed us to change only the necessary game-logic functions and add the new actions for Legends of Valor without needing to change the design structure much at all. Overall, the original implementation we chose helped a lot and made it very quick and easy to create Legend Of Valor.
